# Pen-Pad for SLD Students
The aim of this project is to develop and smart pen and a writing pad for students having SLDs(Special Learning Disabilities) by intergrating assitive technology to aid their learning.

# Ideation

To build a pen and pad for students with SLDs, we must first understand what these SLDs are and how we can include assistive technology to aid them in the learning process.

# Implementation

The project repository contians the KiCad design for the PCB that will be placed inside the smart pen. 

It contains an ESP32 connected to a mic and a bluetooth module to communicate with a Raspberry Pi Compute to send audio data.

The Raspberry Pi Compute has an onboard offline Machine Learning Model called VOSK, which converts audio to text.


# Technolgies Used
